# Ecological Marine Unit Explorer Android

This repo is home to an Esri example application that uses the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android](https://developers.arcgis.com/android/) to showcase ocean ecosystems.  Explore 50 years worth of NOAA data using Esri maps and services!

## Features

## Development Instructions
This Ecological Marine Unit Explorer repo is an Android Studio Project and App Module that can be directly cloned and imported into Android Studio. 

### Fork the repo
**Fork** the [Ecological Marine Unit Explorer Android](https://github.com/Esri/ecological-marine-unit-android/fork) repo.

### Clone the repo
Once you have forked the repo, you can make a clone

#### Command line Git
1. [Clone the Ecological Marine Unit Explorer repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo#step-2-clone-your-fork)
2. ```cd``` into the ```ecological-marine-unit-android``` folder
3. Make your changes and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

### Configuring a Remote for a Fork
If you make changes in the fork and would like to [sync](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) those changes with the upstream repository, you must first [configure the remote](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/). This will be required when you have created local branches and would like to make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to your upstream branch.

1. In the Terminal (for Mac users) or command prompt (fow Windows and Linux users) type ```git remote -v``` to list the current configured remote repo for your fork.
2. ```git remote add upstream https://github.com/Esri/ecological-marine-unit-android`git``` to specify new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork. You can type ```git remote -v``` to verify the new upstream.

If there are changes made in the Original repository, you can sync the fork to keep it updated with upstream repository.

1. In the terminal, change the current working directory to your local project
2. Type ```git fetch upstream``` to fetch the commits from the upstream repository
3. ```git checkout master``` to checkout your fork's local master branch.
4. ```git merge upstream/master``` to sync your local `master' branch with `upstream/master`. **Note**: Your local changes will be retained and your fork's master branch will be in sync with the upstream repository.

The Model View Presenter architecture is used in this application.  The descriptions below were taken from this [site](http://www.tinmegali.com/en/model-view-presenter-android-part-1/).
Presenter

The Presenter is responsible to act as the middle man between View and Model. It retrieves data from the Model and returns it formatted to the View. But unlike the typical MVC, it also decides what happens when you interact with the View.

View

The View, usually implemented by an Activity, will contain a reference to the presenter. The only thing that the view will do is to call a method from the Presenter every time there is an interface action.

Model

In an application with a good layered architecture, this model would only be the gateway to the domain layer or business logic. See it as the provider of the data we want to display in the view.
