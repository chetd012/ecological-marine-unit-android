# Ecological Marine Unit Explorer
Explore our ocean ecosystems with EMUs!

## Description
Using 50 year's worth of aggregated nutrient and physical ocean data from [NOAA](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa13/), Esri has collaborated with the USGS, the Marine Conservation Institute, NatureServe, the University of Auckland, GRID-Arendal, NOAA, Duke University, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and many other partners to classify our oceans into 37 statistically distinct [ecological marine units](http://www.esri.com/ecological-marine-units) (EMUs).  This Android mobile app is one tool you can use to explore ocean conditions locally and globally.

The Model View Presenter architecture is used in this application.  The descriptions below were taken from this [site](http://www.tinmegali.com/en/model-view-presenter-android-part-1/).
Presenter

The Presenter is responsible to act as the middle man between View and Model. It retrieves data from the Model and returns it formatted to the View. But unlike the typical MVC, it also decides what happens when you interact with the View.

View

The View, usually implemented by an Activity, will contain a reference to the presenter. The only thing that the view will do is to call a method from the Presenter every time there is an interface action.

Model

In an application with a good layered architecture, this model would only be the gateway to the domain layer or business logic. See it as the provider of the data we want to display in the view.
