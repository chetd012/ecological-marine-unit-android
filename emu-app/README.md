# Ecological Marine Unit Explorer
Explore our ocean ecosystems with EMUs!

## Description
Using 50 year's worth of aggregated nutrient and physical ocean data from [NOAA](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/woa13/), Esri has collaborated with the USGS, the Marine Conservation Institute, NatureServe, the University of Auckland, GRID-Arendal, NOAA, Duke University, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and many other partners to classify our oceans into 37 statistically distinct [ecological marine units](http://www.esri.com/ecological-marine-units) (EMUs).  Leveraging the Runtime SDK and ArcGIS, we'll show you how this Android mobile app can be used to explore ocean conditions locally and globally. (TODO: Mention how you can add your own data to enhance this rich data set for your own organization!)

## Feature Services
The heart of this application lies in the rich data stores collected by NOAA and analyzed by the scientific collaboration mentioned above.  Over 50 million spatial and non-spatial datapoints are hosted through AGOL [feature services](http://server.arcgis.com/en/server/10.5/publish-services/windows/what-is-a-feature-service-.htm).  

Why these types of layers?  Show how they're set up.
